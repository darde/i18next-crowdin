  "content": "St. Augustine was home to the first lighthouse in Florida, though the first structure fell into the ocean after its foundation was eroded. The more new and current lighthouse was built on Anastasia Island and completed in 1874. The building received internal plumbing in 1907 and the light was electrified in 1936 and automated in 1955. After that were not longer needed operators to the lighthouse, their houses began to be rented to local residents.",
